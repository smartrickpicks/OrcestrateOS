ROUTE: BUILD_TASK_REPLIT
goal: Implement offline-first PDF caching for SRR with realistic limits and deterministic LRU eviction (per-file 25MB, total 250MB), plus Cache UI controls, aligned to V1 local ingest + V1.5 copy-in connectors.
constraints:
- Cache is local-only; no background sync.
- Do not claim Drive/Sheets connectors exist unless implemented.
- Canonical tokens unchanged; UI labels may alias.
files_in_scope:
- `ui/viewer/index.html`
- `docs/ui/views/single_row_review_view.md`
- `docs/ui/views/data_source_view.md`
- `docs/AUDIT_LOG.md`
implementation_steps:
1) Cache index + stats
- Requirements:
  - Add a cache index stored locally (IndexedDB preferred; if not, localStorage index + IndexedDB blobs).
  - Track per entry: key, source_url, size_bytes, created_at, last_accessed_at, checksum (sha256 or stable placeholder if too heavy).
  - Compute stats: file count, total bytes, max bytes.
- Acceptance tests:
  - Cache stats display accurate count + total MB in the Cache section.

2) Cache lookup + load path
- Requirements:
  - On SRR PDF request: compute cache key (join identity + source_url).
  - If cached: update last_accessed_at and render from cached blob (object URL).
  - If not cached: attempt fetch (online); validate PDF signature; enforce per-file cap.
  - If offline or fetch fails: show deterministic “Document not available offline” stub (no crash).
- Acceptance tests:
  - Cache hit renders without refetch; last_accessed updates.
  - Offline miss shows stub.

3) LRU eviction (deterministic)
- Requirements:
  - Before caching a new PDF, if total would exceed 250MB, evict LRU entries until enough space.
  - If a single PDF exceeds 25MB: do not cache; still allow viewing if it can be fetched.
- Acceptance tests:
  - >25MB file is not cached and shows “Not cached (too large)”.
  - Adding files beyond 250MB triggers eviction of oldest last_accessed entries.

4) Clear cache UI
- Requirements:
  - Wire “Clear cached PDFs” to delete all cached blobs and reset index + stats.
- Acceptance tests:
  - Clear cache sets stats to 0 and removes cached entries.

5) Docs updates (exact, no invented integrations)
- Requirements:
  - Update SRR doc: caching behavior, caps, offline stub behavior.
  - Update Data Source doc: “download once, work locally” semantics; connectors are copy-in stubs unless implemented.
  - Update AUDIT_LOG doc: add cache index contract fields and note cache operations are local UI concerns (not governance events unless explicitly logged).
- Acceptance tests:
  - Docs reflect caps (25MB/250MB) and LRU policy exactly.
