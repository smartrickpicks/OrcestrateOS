Replit Task: Fill Missing SRR Handoff Documentation (Shared Store, record_id, queues, debug)

Please update documentation to fill all gaps listed in srr-handoff-status.md (“What is Missing”). Keep updates concise and consistent with the current implementation.

1) Shared PatchRequest Store
Add a new section (or update existing) describing:

PATCH_REQUEST_STORE / pr: prefix usage
Shared across roles (Analyst/Verifier/Admin)
Single source of truth for reviewer hydration
Canonical storage key format
Which actions create/update PatchRequest
Suggested placement:
HANDOFF.md or new section in STATUS.md

2) record_id Routing Strategy
Document:

Why row index is not allowed
record_id generation (hash‑based)
Canonical fingerprint formula
Difference between system record_id and external IDs
Suggested placement:
single_row_review_view.md or overview.md

3) Verifier SRR Hydration
Document:

Required lookup sequence:
patch_request_id → record_id → record
Blocking error behavior if patch missing
Reader‑only row inspector + patch inspector
Suggested placement:
verifier_review_view.md

4) Queue Item Schema
Document required queue fields:

dataset_id
record_id
patch_request_id
division_id
queue_item_id, role, assigned_to_user_id, status
Suggested placement:
HANDOFF.md or verifier.md

5) UUID Alias Capture
Document:

RFC4122 regex detection
Storage in _identity.aliases[]
Aliases not used as record_id
Future Truth Config promotion path
Suggested placement:
overview.md or single_row_review_view.md

6) Artifact Store Integration
Document:

LocalStorage mock filesystem layout
Artifact ID generation logic
Event log usage
Suggested placement:
HANDOFF.md or INTERFACES.md

7) Debug Panel
Document:

?debug=1 URL param
What fields are shown (role, tenant_id, dataset_id, record_id, patch_request_id, storage keys)
Suggested placement:
verifier_review_view.md (or STATUS.md)

Acceptance
All missing items are addressed in docs.
“What is Missing” list can be closed or updated with links.
Updates are concise and cross‑linked in INDEX.md if necessary.
Suggested commit: docs: fill srr handoff gaps

If you want, I can also pin exact file locations and headings based on your preferred doc structure.
