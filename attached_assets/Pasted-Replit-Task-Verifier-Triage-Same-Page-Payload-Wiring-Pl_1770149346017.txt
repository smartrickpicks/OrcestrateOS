Replit Task: Verifier Triage (Same Page) + Payload Wiring

Please update index.html to introduce a Verifier Triage view that lives in the same Triage page location, and wire analyst actions into a verifier payload queue for demo purposes.

Assumptions (use these unless conflict exists)

Use existing Reviewer mode to represent the Verifier role.
Verifier triage appears in the same Triage page container, replacing the analyst triage view when in Reviewer mode.
Persist payloads in localStorage so the demo survives refresh.
1) Verifier Triage view (same location as Analyst Triage)

When mode === reviewer, show a Verifier Triage panel in the existing Triage page area.
Analyst triage content should be hidden in reviewer mode.
Verifier queues (top cards or tabs)

RFIs
Corrections
Blacklist / Blocked
Awaiting Admin
Resolved
Verifier queue list (below)

Show a list/table of payloads in the selected queue.
Columns: Type, Record, Field, Value, Comment, Analyst, Submitted Time, Status, Actions.
Actions

Approve
Request Clarification
Send to Admin
Actions update payload status and move items between queues.

2) Payload schema (demo‑ready)
Create a single payload structure for RFI / Correction / Blacklist:

id
type (rfi, correction, blacklist)
record_id or contract_key
sheet, field
old_value, new_value
comment
analyst_id (stub ok)
timestamp
status (pending, needs_clarification, approved, sent_to_admin, resolved)
Persist in localStorage (e.g., srr_verifier_queue_v1).

3) Wire analyst actions into verifier queue

On Send RFI: add payload type=rfi, status=pending.
On Submit Patch Request for Correction: add payload type=correction, status=pending.
On Blacklist submit: add payload type=blacklist, status=pending.
These payloads should appear in Verifier Triage queues.
Acceptance

Verifier triage shows inside Triage page in reviewer mode.
Analyst triage remains in analyst mode.
RFI / Correction / Blacklist actions create payloads and appear in verifier queue.
Verifier action buttons update payload status and move items between queues.
Payloads persist across refresh.
