Replit Task: Reviewer SRR Open Failure — Fix PatchRequest ↔ Record Resolution (Local-Only)

Please debug and fix why Reviewer cannot open the SRR from the all‑data grid or triage when a PatchRequest exists. In reviewer mode, clicking a row currently shows “No PatchRequest available” or “record not found.” This must work using the local, shared PatchRequest store (no backend).

Goal
When an analyst submits a patch (RFI/Correction/Blacklist), the reviewer should always be able to open the SRR from triage and from the grid, and see the correct record + patch payload.

Root issues to fix

Reviewer grid lookup is failing to find PatchRequests for records
Verifier Review → “Open Record / Single Row Review” uses the wrong patch store and fails to resolve the record
SRR open path fails if it can’t find the record in the workbook (needs local record store fallback)
Required Fixes

1) Use the canonical PATCH_REQUEST_STORE everywhere
Replace any legacy patch store reads (like srr_patch_requests_v1) with PATCH_REQUEST_STORE.

Example: openRecordFromPayload() currently pulls from legacy storage. It must use PATCH_REQUEST_STORE.get(patch_request_id) (or artifact store if only artifact_id exists).
2) Ensure reviewer grid resolves PatchRequests correctly
Reviewer grid should map record_id → patch_request_id reliably.

Build the reviewer map from PATCH_REQUEST_STORE.list() (and optionally from artifacts if missing)
The grid should check record.record_id first, fallback only if necessary to contract_key
If patch exists but not found, log a debug message showing the missing record_id and the known patch IDs.
3) Fix SRR open routing to record store fallback
In reviewer/verifier/admin SRR, when opening with {dataset_id, record_id, patch_request_id}:

Load PatchRequest first
If record not found in workbook rows, load from local record store:
{record_id}.json
Only error if both workbook + record store fail.
4) Ensure PatchRequest payload includes dataset_id + record_id
When analyst submits:

PatchRequest must include dataset_id and record_id
Queue items must carry dataset_id, record_id, patch_request_id, division_id
If any of those are missing, add them during submit.

5) Add Debug Clarity (temporary)
When reviewer can’t open:

Show a blocking message that includes
dataset_id, record_id, patch_request_id, and the storage keys checked.
Acceptance Tests

Analyst submits patch → reviewer grid row shows patch status and opens SRR
Verifier Review “Open Single Row Review” works and shows same patch data
Sorting/filtering grid doesn’t break open behavior
If record not found, error screen shows exact keys and IDs checked (no silent fail)
Suggested commit
fix(srr): reviewer SRR opens via shared patch store + record fallback
