Replit Task: P1 Implement Schema Tree Editor + Alias Bundle Migration

Goal:
Upgrade Admin Standardizer into a lazy-render Schema Tree Editor and migrate column alias logic from code into rules_bundle JSON.

Constraints:
- Use repo-relative paths only.
- Reuse existing SessionDB and AuditTimeline.
- Keep current V1 flows working (non-regression).
- No backend/services.

Scope (P1):
1) Rules bundle alias migration
- Add/maintain rules_bundle/column_aliases.json as canonical alias source.
- Refactor resolver to load aliases at startup from rules_bundle/column_aliases.json.
- Alias normalization: case/underscore/punctuation insensitive.
- Alias conflicts hard-fail to Manual Review with admin decision required.

2) Schema Tree Editor (Admin > Standardizer)
- Lazy render tree (expand on demand), ordered by sheet_order.
- Render/edit:
  - rules_bundle/field_meta.json
  - rules_bundle/hinge_groups.json
  - rules_bundle/sheet_order.json
  - rules_bundle/qa_flags.json
  - config/document_types.json
  - rules_bundle/column_aliases.json
- Unknown columns as PENDING nodes under mapped sheet or Unassigned.

3) Unknown classification actions
- Rename to existing -> create alias patch candidate
- Add new canonical field -> schema patch candidate
- Create legal-entity rule -> tenant_rule patch candidate
- Ignore/suppress -> suppression patch candidate

4) Change buffer + draft + diff
- Track per-node edits in a diff buffer.
- Undo per-node.
- Save Draft to SessionDB.
- Preview Diff.
- Export Patch artifact.
- Apply Locally (runtime apply only; still requires lifecycle for promotion).

5) AuditTimeline events
- Emit generic schema_change with subtype:
  - schema_patch
  - doctype_patch
  - alias_patch
  - tenant_rule_patch
  - suppression_patch
- Aggregate where possible (counts + sample IDs).

6) Non-regression checks
- Existing dropdown fields and glossary tooltips still work.
- Existing triage, SRR, and patch submit flows unchanged.

Output format:
- Alignment of Task: <one line>
- Exact files/functions touched with approximate line ranges
- P1 checklist with PASS/FAIL
- Demo steps
- Any deferred items marked for P2
