Replit Task: Demo Dataset Baseline + PDF Placeholder Folder

Goal
Use the Ostereo dataset as the standard schema columns, generate a clean synthetic demo dataset, and wire a placeholder PDF folder so real PDFs can be dropped in later.

Assumptions
- Use Ostereo “Accounts” sheet columns as the canonical schema for demo rows (fallback: first sheet if “Accounts” not found).
- Keep the PDF viewer functional using local placeholder paths, without external network dependencies.

Requirements
1) Add demo dataset JSON
- Add `examples/datasets/ostereo_demo_v1.json` (from Codex) into this repo.
- If it already exists, replace it.

2) Build synthetic demo dataset from schema
- Generate a lightweight demo dataset (e.g., 30–50 rows) using the Ostereo “Accounts” columns.
- Save as `examples/datasets/ostereo_demo_synthetic.json`.
- Use realistic placeholder values (names, addresses, emails, etc.). It doesn’t have to be perfect, just structured.

3) Make the synthetic dataset the default demo load
- Update `ui/viewer/index.html` to load `ostereo_demo_synthetic.json` as the default dataset on cold start.
- Remove or disable legacy sample datasets (no “Sample Dataset” in menus).

4) PDF placeholder support
- Create a folder: `ui/viewer/assets/pdfs/`
- Add a placeholder PDF file: `ui/viewer/assets/pdfs/placeholder.pdf` (simple one‑page stub).
- Update dataset rows so their PDF path uses a local field (preferably existing `File_URL_c` or `file_url`):
  Example: `/ui/viewer/assets/pdfs/placeholder.pdf`
- Update the PDF loader to prefer local file paths when present and fall back to remote URLs if needed.

5) UI feedback
- If a PDF is missing, show a non-blocking inline message in the viewer:
  “PDF not found. Drop files into ui/viewer/assets/pdfs/”
- Do not break the SRR if PDF is missing.

Acceptance
- App boots with the synthetic demo dataset by default.
- Field Inspector and triage operate on the Ostereo schema columns.
- PDF viewer loads `placeholder.pdf` without errors.
- There is a clear drop-in folder for future PDFs: `ui/viewer/assets/pdfs/`.

Suggested commit message
ui(demo): default ostereo synthetic dataset + pdf placeholder folder
