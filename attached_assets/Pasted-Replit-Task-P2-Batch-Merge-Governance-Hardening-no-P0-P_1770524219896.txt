Replit Task: P2 — Batch Merge + Governance Hardening (no P0/P1 regressions)

Context:
- P0 validation passed.
- Keep existing P0/P1 behavior intact.
- Reuse existing SessionDB + AuditTimeline.
- Use repo-relative paths only.

Goal:
Implement batch merge as an admin governance action and harden scope/promotion behavior for tenant rules in merged batches.

Scope:

1) Admin > Governance: Merge Batches UI
- Add a “Merge Batches” action in Governance.
- Inputs:
  - source batches: batchA, batchB (extendable to N)
  - merged batch label/name
- Output:
  - new `batch_id`
  - `merged_from: [batchA, batchB, ...]`
- Keep contract IDs stable (derived from File_URL logic already in place).

2) Merge data model + storage
- Persist merged batch in SessionDB.
- Represent merged batch as container with read-only child lineage.
- Do not duplicate full row payloads when avoidable; use references/pointers.
- Preserve row-level access and SRR routing.

3) Tenant/legal-entity rule inheritance policy (OFF by default)
- Tenant rules from source batches must NOT auto-apply to merged batch.
- Add explicit promotion path:
  - “Promote rule to merged batch” action (manual, auditable).
- Surface this clearly in UI (badge/message in merged batch governance panel).

4) Triage and views behavior for merged batch
- Triage and contract views should treat merged batch as a single selectable container.
- Contract detail should show source lineage (which source batch each contract/row came from).
- Keep All Data Grid row-default behavior.

5) AuditTimeline events
- Emit:
  - `batch_merged` with source batch IDs, new batch ID, counts
  - `tenant_rule_promoted_to_batch` when manual promotion occurs
- Keep payloads compact with aggregate counts + sample IDs.

6) Governance hardening + docs alignment
- Remove outdated lifecycle wording and ensure docs reflect V2.2 behavior:
  - merged lineage is read-only
  - tenant rule inheritance is OFF
  - explicit promotion required
- Update docs for:
  - merge semantics
  - audit events
  - scope behavior (batch vs merged batch)

7) Safety and fallback
- If merge build fails, do not corrupt source batches.
- Show non-blocking error and keep original batches functional.

Acceptance checklist (must PASS):
- Create merged batch from two existing batches.
- `merged_from[]` is persisted and visible.
- Contracts retain stable contract IDs.
- Tenant rules do not auto-inherit into merged batch.
- Manual tenant-rule promotion works and is auditable.
- Triage/grid/SRR continue to function for source + merged batches.
- `batch_merged` event appears in AuditTimeline and exported audit sheet.
- No regressions in P0/P1 flows.

Output format:
1) Alignment of Task: <one line>
2) Files/functions touched with approx line ranges
3) Checklist table: Item | PASS/FAIL | Evidence
4) Any FAIL: minimal patch plan
5) Manual demo steps for merged batch flow
