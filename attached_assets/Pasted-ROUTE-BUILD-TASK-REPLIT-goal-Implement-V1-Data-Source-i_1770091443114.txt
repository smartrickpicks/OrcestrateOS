ROUTE: BUILD_TASK_REPLIT
goal: Implement V1 Data Source ingestion for local CSV/XLSX into a workbook dataset, with deterministic file_name/file_url column mapping so SRR can render PDFs from real spreadsheets; structure it so V1.5 Google Drive can reuse the same parseWorkbook(bytes, filename) path.
constraints:

Offline-first for parsing (local files only); no Google Drive integration yet.
Do not change canonical ids/routes/spec tokens.
Do not invent a full standardizer; implement minimal deterministic mapping + clear errors.
files_in_scope:
index.html
data_source_view.md
single_row_review_view.md
implementation_steps:
CSV ingestion (single-sheet workbook)
Requirements:
Add CSV upload in Data Source panel that parses into a workbook dataset structure used by the viewer.
Set Active Data Source filename from uploaded file name.
Acceptance tests:
Uploading a CSV enables Triage/Grid/Record Inspection navigation.
Sheet selector shows one sheet.
XLSX ingestion (multi-sheet workbook)
Requirements:
Add XLSX upload in Data Source panel that parses into workbook with multiple sheets.
Populate Sheet selector with sheet names; switching sheets updates Grid/Triage context deterministically.
Implement parser entrypoint as parseWorkbook(arrayBuffer, filename) for future Drive reuse.
Acceptance tests:
Uploading an XLSX shows multiple sheets in Sheet selector.
Switching sheets changes the records displayed in Grid and Triage.
Deterministic column mapping for SRR PDF source
Requirements:
Resolve per-row file_name and file_url using:
Primary: explicit header names file_name and file_url (case-insensitive).
Fallback: if headers are missing/unknown, treat column A as file_name and column B as file_url (DataDash-style).
Persist the resolved mapping in session state; do not mutate source bytes.
If mapping cannot be resolved, show a blocking banner in Data Source: “Missing required columns: file_name/file_url”.
Acceptance tests:
For a row with file_url, Record Inspection renders PDF via URL.
If a sheet lacks resolvable file_name/file_url, Data Source shows the blocking banner and SRR shows empty-state guidance.
Docs alignment
Requirements:
Update data_source_view.md to document CSV/XLSX ingestion + mapping rules.
Update single_row_review_view.md to reference that PDFs come from mapped file_url/file_name.
Acceptance tests:
Docs match implemented behavior and do not claim Drive integration exists.
