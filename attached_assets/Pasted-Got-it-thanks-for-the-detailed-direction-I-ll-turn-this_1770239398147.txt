Got it — thanks for the detailed direction. I’ll turn this into a **single Riplet task** that covers:

- Division = **Unassigned** bucket
- Reviewer Triage **grouped by patch type** (tabs or cards)
- Verifier workflow: **open record → reviewer SRR** with left Field Inspector and right Patch Review + Patch Tester tabs
- Ensure **Open Record** from Verifier Review navigates to this reviewer SRR (read‑only + patch context)

Here’s the consolidated task:

---

**Replit Task: Reviewer Workflow Enhancements (Unassigned Division + Type Tabs + Reviewer SRR View)**

Please update `ui/viewer/index.html` to improve the **Reviewer/Verifier flow** and triage layout.

---

## 1) Division Filter — Unassigned Bucket
- If `division_id` is missing on a PatchRequest, treat it as **“Unassigned”**.
- Add **“Unassigned”** to the division dropdown.
- Items without division_id should appear under **Unassigned**, not disappear.

---

## 2) Reviewer Triage: Group by Patch Type
Add patch‑type grouping on the Reviewer Triage page (in addition to status filter):

- **Tabs or Cards** for patch type:
  - **Corrections**
  - **Blacklist**
  - **RFI**
- Status filter bar (pending_review, needs_clarification, sent_to_admin, resolved) remains.

Behavior:
- Selecting a type + status filters the queue list.

---

## 3) Reviewer Record Inspection (SRR) — Verifier Flow
When a Reviewer clicks a triage row (or “Open Record” from Verifier Review), they should land on a **Reviewer SRR view** that contains:

**Left panel**
- Field Inspector (read‑only)
- Shows **all field states** (Verified, RFI, Blocked, Modified, etc.)
- No edit actions

**Right panel**
- Patch area with **two tabs**:
  1. **Patch Review** (shows analyst’s submitted patch, read‑only)
  2. **Patch Tester** (can adjust and run stub Kiwi test)

**Patch Tester**
- Only visible for **Correction/Blacklist**
- For RFI, hide Patch Tester and show comment thread only.

---

## 4) Routing Fixes
- “Open Record” in Verifier Review must navigate to **Reviewer SRR** (read‑only view).
- SRR must always hydrate from PatchRequest (`patch_request_id`) + record (`dataset_id + record_id`).

---

## Acceptance
- Missing division_id items show under **Unassigned**.
- Reviewer triage can filter by **patch type + status**.
- Reviewer SRR has left read‑only Field Inspector and right Patch Review + Patch Tester tabs.
- Open Record from Verifier Review goes to Reviewer SRR with correct patch context.

Suggested commit: `ui(srr): reviewer workflow + type tabs + unassigned division`

If you want the triage to show **summary cards** (counts per patch type + status), I can add that too.
