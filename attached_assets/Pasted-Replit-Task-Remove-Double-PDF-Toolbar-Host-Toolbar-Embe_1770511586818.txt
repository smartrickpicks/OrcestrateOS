Replit Task: Remove Double PDF Toolbar (Host Toolbar + Embedded Viewer Toolbar)

Alignment of task:
The issue is not clipping. Record Inspection currently shows two toolbars: our host “Document Viewer” toolbar and the embedded PDF viewer’s native toolbar. Keep only one toolbar.

Problem:
- Outer app frame renders its own PDF controls (Prev/Next, page, zoom).
- Embedded PDF viewer (inside iframe/object) renders another full toolbar.
- Result: duplicate bars and noisy UX.

Goal:
Use a single control surface in V1.

Preferred approach:
- Keep the outer app toolbar as canonical.
- Hide embedded viewer chrome/toolbar if possible via URL params or viewer mode.
- If embedded toolbar cannot be hidden for this rendering path, remove outer duplicate controls and keep only embedded toolbar.
- Choose one path and apply consistently.

Repo targets:
- ui/viewer/index.html
- any PDF render helper/styles tied to Record Inspection

Implementation tasks:
1) Identify all toolbar render paths
- Host toolbar DOM in Record Inspection
- Embedded toolbar from iframe/object/pdf.js viewer

2) Enforce one-toolbar policy
- Either:
  A) Host toolbar only:
     - Configure embed URL to hide native toolbar/nav panes if supported
     - Keep host controls wired
  B) Embedded toolbar only:
     - Remove/hide host Prev/Next/page/zoom row and keep title/action row
- Do not leave both visible.

3) Keep title/action row
- Keep file title + Edit Link + Download row above viewer content.

4) Preserve anchor behavior
- Anchor jump/search should still work.
- No route refresh/reset.
- No duplicate event firing from removed toolbar path.

5) Clean CSS
- Remove spacing/margins reserved for now-removed duplicate bar.
- Ensure viewer fills available area cleanly.

Acceptance criteria:
- Exactly one toolbar is visible in Document Viewer at all times.
- File title/action row remains visible and functional.
- Prev/Next/page/zoom still function through the chosen canonical toolbar.
- Anchor jump/match flow still works.
- No console errors and no duplicate handlers.

Required output format:
1) Alignment of task
2) Chosen one-toolbar strategy (A or B) and why
3) Files changed
4) Before vs after behavior
5) Smoke test results
