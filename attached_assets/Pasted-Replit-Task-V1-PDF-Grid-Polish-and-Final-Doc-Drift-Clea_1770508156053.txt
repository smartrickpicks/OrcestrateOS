Replit Task: V1 PDF + Grid Polish and Final Doc Drift Cleanup

Alignment of task:
Audit timeline is complete. Finalize V1 UX correctness for record navigation, PDF anchor behavior, status color semantics, and remaining doc mismatch.

Repo targets:
- ui/viewer/index.html
- docs/ui/views/single_row_review_view.md
- docs/ui/views/ui_evidence_pack.md
- docs/ui/ui_principles.md

Scope:
1) Grid click behavior
- Row click in all-data/triage opens Record Inspection (never triggers file download).
- Download must be explicit via dedicated action only.

2) PDF anchor behavior finalization
- Anchor click:
  - jump to first match page
  - show active match index
  - next/prev moves through matches and updates page
- If no match:
  - non-blocking toast only
  - no sticky overlays
- Prevent route reload or session reset on anchor operations.

3) PDF viewer cleanup
- Ensure only one active viewer surface is rendered at a time (no double-viewer artifacts).
- Remove any duplicate mount logic that can create competing iframe/object states.

4) Status color consistency
- Normalize triage/grid/record status color mapping to one source of truth.
- Ensure same status uses same color in:
  - row badges
  - queue chips
  - field chips
- Add a small status legend reference in UI if needed.

5) SRR doc mismatch cleanup (explicit issue)
- In docs/ui/views/single_row_review_view.md:
  - fields marked “coming soon” (Blacklist Category, RFI Target) must not be listed as V1-required or optional validation rules.
  - Clearly mark as future-only, non-enforced in V1.

6) Evidence/doc sanity pass
- Confirm docs/ui/views/ui_evidence_pack.md and docs/ui/ui_principles.md remain aligned with implemented gate behavior from recent releases.

Acceptance criteria:
- Clicking any grid/triage row opens Record Inspection; no unintended downloads.
- Anchor jump visibly navigates and iterates matches without page reload.
- No duplicate PDF viewer rendering.
- Status colors are consistent across surfaces.
- SRR “coming soon” fields are not treated as active validation requirements in docs.

Required output format:
1) Alignment of task
2) Before vs after behavior matrix
3) Files changed
4) Visual consistency checklist (status colors + viewer behavior)
5) Smoke tests run
6) Remaining risks/deferred items
