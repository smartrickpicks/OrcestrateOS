# Orchestrate OS — Semantic Control Board

## Overview
Orchestrate OS is a governance-only semantic control plane designed to define, validate, and preview semantic rules offline. It acts as a single source of semantic truth to streamline patch requests, improve operator efficiency, and provide an analyst-centric reference for explicit, deterministic, and auditable decisions. Its core purpose is to enhance semantic rule management, reduce errors, and boost decision-making efficiency by capturing semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts and operating with deterministic outputs in an offline-first manner. The business vision is to deliver a robust platform for managing complex semantic rules, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating efficient operational decision-making.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The system employs a Config Pack Model with strict version matching and a 12-status patch request lifecycle, including comment systems and role-based access control. The UI/UX features a dashboard with a queue-centric sidebar, right-side drawers, role-based navigation, and a Patch Studio for drafting, preflight checks, live previews, and revision tracking. Data handling supports CSV/XLSX import, inline editing, a lock-on-commit mechanism with a change map engine, and workbook session caching.

Authentication employs Google OAuth for human users and scoped API keys for service ingestion, with strict workspace isolation. A sandbox/demo mode is available. Key features include a "Contract Line Item Wizard," XLSX export, Audit Timeline, Schema Tree Editor, Batch Merge, `SystemPass` for deterministic changes, `UndoManager` for session-scoped draft edits, `RollbackEngine` for governed rollback artifacts, and a Triage Analytics module. An Evidence Viewer provides document-level text anchoring, a corrections workflow, RFI custody tracking, and an interactive panel with unified click behavior for validation. Reader mode includes text extraction, formatting, Mojibake inline detection, and OCR escalation. Sandbox Session Management ensures artifact persistence.

A heuristic suggestion engine analyzes source document column headers, proposing mappings to canonical glossary terms using various matching techniques. The UI Suggestions Panel features keyword overlay highlighting, linked fields, and a compact diagnostics status line. Users can accept/decline suggestions, which auto-creates glossary aliases. Section Metadata Integration groups and orders fields in the record inspector.

Glossary Fuzzy Confidence Scoring uses a 6-component weighted formula for candidate scoring, categorizing confidence into HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, and HIDDEN buckets, with deterministic tie-breaking. Normalization includes NFKC, lowercase, punctuation stripping, and noise token removal. Candidate suppression filters out irrelevant strings. Single-Token Domain Boost applies a specific boost for single-token candidates matching multi-token glossary entries. Category Starvation Prevention ensures balanced representation across glossary categories. Scoring Config Freeze centralizes all scoring weights, thresholds, and boost multipliers. Export Contract Hardening validates cached state completeness before building export payloads.

The OGC Preparation Simulator Operations View provides a multi-batch, DB-first governance queue, unifying patches, RFIs, and corrections into a single feed. Feature flags enable gradual migration to a PostgreSQL-backed Annotation Layer. The Verifier Organizational View provides a workspace-level governance dashboard with KPI summaries, batch queues, batch drill-downs, and a filter bar, guarded by RBAC. Verifier Triage Unification migrates this view into a canonical `#page-triage` frame, creating a role-adaptive interface.

Dark Mode v2 ("Subtle Futuristic Neon Control Panel") uses `ui/viewer/theme.css` as the single source of truth for all color tokens, supporting both light and dark modes. The toggle persists to localStorage. The Sidebar Icon System uses inline SVG icons with `currentColor` inheritance. A Collapsible Sidebar feature persists state to localStorage.

The CSV-backed Account Resolver provides 3-tier deterministic matching (exact → token overlap → edit distance) against `CMG_Account.csv` via `AccountIndex`. Preflight Test Lab — Salesforce Match Integration wires the Salesforce account resolver into the preflight pipeline. The preflight engine uses `extract_account_candidates` with strict extraction logic and header fallback. The UI renders a matrix-style table with Source Text, Mapped Account, Match Status, Confidence, and Evidence columns, positioned after encoding findings.

Multi-Account Aware Composite Scoring adds context-aware scoring via `server/resolvers/context_scorer.py`. Each candidate gets a composite score based on name, address, account context, and service penalty. Resolution Story P0 adds `build_resolution_story()` to `server/preflight_engine.py`, producing a structured narrative from SF match results. New Entry Detection (v2.57+): When CMG legal entity is resolved but a counterparty extracted from the contract party/recital block is not found in the Salesforce account index, the system sets `new_entry_detected=true`, populates `unresolved_counterparties[]`, and generates an `onboarding_recommendation` with suggested account name, type, and reason. The frontend shows a prominent "NEW ENTRY DETECTED" banner and a manual unresolved entry input.

Deterministic Contract Classification (v2.58+): `server/data/preflight_contract_rules.v1.json` is the single source of truth for contract categories, expected schedule types, and termination flavors. `server/preflight_rules.py` evaluates the rules JSON deterministically, producing `contract_category`, `expected_schedule_types`, `termination_flavor` (with label and evidence), and `subtypes_allowed`.

Patch Submit Modal (v2.57+) replaces the old Patch tab in the SRR sidebar with a centered modal dialog. The SRR left panel now has only two tabs: Edit and Info. After any action (field edit + Submit, RFI chip, Blacklist chip), a modal opens showing: patch type badge, context-appropriate summary, evidence fields for corrections, and a required justification textarea.

V2.58 Reconstruction Completion Gates wire the generate_copy → reconstruction_complete → override_red flow into the Contract Generator (cgb builder). `_pfGateState` tracks multi-step progression (`generateCopyDone`, `reconstructionCompleteDone`, `overrideRedDone`).
